 * calldata: honest is `swapMonForUsdc` on the router, attack is the
 * "enable trading" approval, `approve(look-alike, unlimited)` on dUSDC.
 * The same builders feed the panel's check and the wallet's signature, so
 * what Baret checks is what the wallet signs.
 *
 * Live when there is an address to simulate from (a connected wallet, or
 * VITE_BARET_DEMO_FROM): the request goes to Baret's server and fails
 * closed. With no address, the prepared sample, and nothing is fetched.
