 * One opener frame. Frames swap on discrete scroll steps and tween on time,
 * so a paused scroll never shows a half-blended pair.
 *
 * The swap is a cut through the ink ground, never a dissolve: the outgoing
 * frame sits on top and fades to the graphite stage in 160 ms (the caption's
 * own fade-out), and only then does the incoming frame fade up beneath it.
 * The two photos are never on screen at partial opacity together, and the
 * photo changes in the same beat as the caption (LinePlate). The order is the
 * same in both directions. A frame that leaves the pair drops out at once.
