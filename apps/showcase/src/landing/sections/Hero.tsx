/**
 * The hero: one photo, one copy column, one action row. No plate, no card.
 *
 * From 1024 px the night skyline (l-01) fills the section and the copy sits
 * straight on its empty sky in columns 1 to 7, centred vertically. No eyebrow pill: the network status
 * lives in the closing note. From 1440 px the photo is scaled 1.2x from
 * its lower right corner, so the towers fill the right 55 % and sit close to
 * the copy instead of leaving an empty half. The skyline starts right of
 * column 6 at every width from 1024 to 1920. Distant window lights behind
 * the body drop single pixels to 3.6:1 at 1024 and 1280, so one flat 35 %
 * graphite veil covers the whole photo. No gradient scrim: measured on the
 * static frame, the flat veil alone keeps the body (chalk at 80 %) at a worst
 * pixel of 6.8:1 at 1440 and 7.7:1 or more at 1024, 1280 and 1920, above the
 * old 30 % veil plus left-hand ramp at every width.
 * Below 1024 px the photo is a band on top (280 px, 360 px from 768) with no
 * text on it, and the copy follows on plain graphite. The copy column is a
 * size container and the H1 is sized in cqi (T.h1), so it grows with its
 * column and never jumps at a breakpoint.
 *
 * Motion (none under reduced motion): from 768 px the photo drifts 3.5 %
 * each way against the scroll and settles from 1.04x (2.5 % and 1.02x from
 * 1440 px; the phone band stays still, shared/Parallax), and a WebGL2 layer
 * repeats it pixel for pixel with a static paper grain and a few pixels of
 * lean toward the pointer (shared/webgl). On phones and coarse pointers the
 * canvas only carries the scan pass, then fades back to the native img. One orange scan pass runs once the hero is three quarters
 * in view, the H1 has landed and the scroll is at rest; from 1024 px it
 * starts right of the copy and crosses only the skyline. Its rule
 * (ScanLine) sits above the veil, so it reads as true International Orange;
 * for its 1.7 s it is accepted as a second orange beside the primary action.
 * The <img> stays underneath as the LCP and the fallback.
 *
 * The H1 reveals word by word once its top passes 65 % of the viewport
 * (HERO_VIEWPORT; shared/TextReveal in controlled mode, one sentence per
 * line). Not on mount: the hero sits under the 166svh sticky opener, so a
 * mount-time reveal would play unseen. The body and actions never wait for
 * an animation: they are plain text from the first paint. The body's first
 * sentence is set in chalk, the rest at 80 %. The hero photo is lazy: the
 * hero is never in the first viewport, so it never competes with the LCP.
 * Reduced motion: plain text.
 *
 * The 56px in min-h is the header height, owned by
 * HEADER_OFFSET in shared/layout.ts.
