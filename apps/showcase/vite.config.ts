/**
 * Vite 8 runs on Rolldown, so the options are `oxc` and `rolldownOptions`
 * rather than `esbuild` and `rollupOptions`.
 *
 * React Compiler goes through Babel rather than the plugin's native `compiler`
 * flag. The native path is faster but is still marked experimental, and this
 * is the exact compiler the React team documents. Revisit when the flag loses
 * the experimental label.
 *
 * The static head (IMPROVE G1: title, description, og:*, twitter:card and the
 * LCP preload for link-preview bots) and the per-route heads, sitemap and
 * robots line (G4, G5) come from `baretHead()` in scripts/head.mjs. That file
 * reads @baret/content and assets.ts, which are TypeScript with `.js`
 * specifiers that Node's native loader (used for this config) cannot resolve,
 * so it goes through Vite's module runner instead of a static import.
 *
 * BARET_SITE_URL is read inside that plugin with loadEnv, not by widening
 * `envPrefix`: a `BARET_` prefix would expose every BARET_* variable to
 * client code, and the client never needs the site URL.
