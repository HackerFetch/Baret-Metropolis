/**
 * Vercel Routing Middleware, in front of this site's `/api` rewrite to the
 * Baret server (vercel.json).
 *
 * It marks every request the site sends on with `x-baret-edge`, a secret the
 * server shares (BARET_EDGE_SECRET on both sides), and names the visitor's
 * address in `x-baret-client`. The server then knows the request came through
 * this site's edge and who the visitor is, so a caller who goes to the server
 * directly cannot pass for a visitor or invent addresses to dodge the rate
 * limits (apps/server/src/api/client.ts, docs/SYSTEM_GAPS.md G-17).
 *
 * The address is the one Vercel saw the connection from, not the
 * X-Forwarded-For the rewrite passes on: measured live, a visitor's made-up
 * X-Forwarded-For sometimes reaches the server in front of that list.
 *
 * Whatever the browser sent under those two names is dropped, never passed
 * on. With no secret set neither is sent and the rewrite goes on as before.
