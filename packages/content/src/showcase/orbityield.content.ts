/**
 * /orbityield on apps/showcase. Trust trap. Blocked under Balanced since
 * D-033 (2026-10-09); it was Caution before.
 *
 * Story: a staking page that promises a receipt token for every MON staked.
 * The page shows nothing wrong. The missing receipt is the only sign, and it
 * shows in the balance change, not on the page.
 *
 * Old versions claimed a check for "no unstake function" and "inflated TVL".
 * No detector does either, so this version is built on what the detectors
 * really see: which contract is called and what arrives.
 *
 * Honest version: stake(), payable, on the demo OrbitYield pool. oMON arrives
 * one to one; the pool has a working unstake. Expected Safe, no findings.
 * Needs: the pool on a list Baret reads.
 *
 * Attack version: the same button calls a second pool that is on no list,
 * keeps the MON and sends no oMON. Expected Blocked under Balanced: a
 * payment an unknown contract keeps is blocked by blockRiskyContracts (D-033).
 * Caution under Permissive. Codes:
 *   VALUE_KEPT_BY_UNKNOWN_CONTRACT  MON out, nothing in, from a contract on
 *                                no list; blockRiskyContracts
 *   UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_EXPOSURE    needs the known-contract list to be in use;
 *                                blockUnknownContractExposure (off in Balanced)
 *   ESTIMATED_LOSS_EXCEEDS_MAX   only when the amount typed crosses the
 *                                visitor's loss limit; then Blocked
 *
 * Watch for -> source:
 *   1 a pool Baret does not know  UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_EXPOSURE
 *   2 MON out, no oMON in         What changes (estimatedChanges)
 *   3 loss above your limit       ESTIMATED_LOSS_EXCEEDS_MAX (amount-dependent)
