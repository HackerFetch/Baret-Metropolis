/**
 * /launchpad on apps/showcase. Trust trap. Caution, on purpose.
 *
 * Story: a polished token sale. The tokens really arrive. The risk is what the
 * deployer can change after the sale, and that shows in the call trace, not
 * on the page.
 *
 * Old versions claimed checks for "admin key kept" and "LP not locked". No
 * detector reads either, so this version uses what the evm-danger detector
 * does see: the sale runs borrowed code (a proxy the deployer can repoint).
 *
 * Honest version: contribute(), payable, on a plain sale contract with fixed
 * code. LNTL arrives in the same transaction. Expected Safe, no findings.
 * Needs: the sale contract on a list Baret reads; 0.001 MON per LNTL,
 * minimum 0.01 MON, maximum 1 MON per wallet to match the page.
 *
 * Attack version: the same button calls a sale proxy that delegatecalls into
 * an implementation its deployer can replace. LNTL still arrives. Expected
 * Caution under Balanced, Blocked under Strict. Codes:
 *   DELEGATECALL_DETECTED        needs a call trace (debug_traceCall on the
 *                                Monad RPC); blockDelegatecall
 *   UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_EXPOSURE    proxy and implementation on no list;
 *                                blockUnknownContractExposure (off in Balanced)
 *   ESTIMATED_LOSS_EXCEEDS_MAX   only when the amount typed crosses the
 *                                visitor's loss limit; then Blocked
 * If no trace is available, expect LOW_CONFIDENCE_INCOMPLETE_DATA instead of
 * DELEGATECALL_DETECTED.
 *
 * Watch for -> source:
 *   1 borrowed code              DELEGATECALL_DETECTED
 *   2 a sale Baret does not know UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_EXPOSURE
 *   3 loss above your limit      ESTIMATED_LOSS_EXCEEDS_MAX (amount-dependent)
