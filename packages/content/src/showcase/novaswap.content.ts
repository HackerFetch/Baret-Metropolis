/**
 * /novaswap on apps/showcase. Drainer. Story per DECISIONS D-018.
 *
 * Runs on real Monad testnet contracts (`@baret/demo`, CONTRACTS.md section
 * 7): a test token dUSDC (never taken for real USDC), the NovaSwap router at
 * a fixed 3.2 dUSDC per MON, and a look-alike router whose address starts
 * and ends like the real one.
 *
 * Honest version: swapMonForUsdc(minOut), payable, on the router. MON out,
 * dUSDC in, both in your wallet. Expected Safe, no findings. Needs no
 * allowance.
 *
 * Attack version: the card turns into a dUSDC sale that first asks to
 * "enable dUSDC trading": approve(look-alike, unlimited). With an ordinary
 * wallet the following "swap" takes the whole dUSDC balance to a sink.
 * Expected Blocked, twice:
 *   ERC20_APPROVAL_UNLIMITED   the allowance has no limit
 *   KNOWN_MALICIOUS_ADDRESS    the look-alike is on the registry's list
 *
 * Watch for -> source:
 *   1 unlimited allowance        ERC20_APPROVAL_UNLIMITED (approvals)
 *   2 spender one character off  the router address on the Docs page
 *   3 reported spender           KNOWN_MALICIOUS_ADDRESS (registry)
 *
 * Keep demo swaps under half the wallet's MON: Baret does not price MON
 * against dUSDC, so the Balanced 50 % loss limit would block a bigger swap.
