/**
 * /claimhub on apps/showcase. Drainer. The hub's first stop.
 *
 * Story: an airdrop page. The eligibility check is theatre. What the claim
 * button builds is the whole scenario.
 *
 * Honest version: claim() on the demo distributor. HUB arrives, nothing of
 * yours can be spent later. Expected Safe, no findings. Needs: the distributor
 * on a list Baret reads (or UNKNOWN_CONTRACT_EXPOSURE turns it into Caution),
 * repeat claims allowed per address (or the second try reverts), 2,410 HUB
 * sent per claim to match the page.
 *
 * Attack version: approve(spender, max uint256) on the canonical test USDC.
 * Expected Blocked. Codes:
 *   ERC20_APPROVAL_UNLIMITED   always, from the calldata; blockUnlimitedApprovals
 *   KNOWN_MALICIOUS_ADDRESS    only if the demo spender is on the registry
 *                              blocklist; blockKnownMalicious
 * The approval simulates fine with a zero USDC balance, so a visitor with
 * only faucet MON still sees it.
 *
 * Watch for -> source:
 *   1 unlimited allowance         ERC20_APPROVAL_UNLIMITED
 *   2 spender on the blocklist    KNOWN_MALICIOUS_ADDRESS (seeded)
 *   3 nothing arriving            What changes (estimatedChanges): no HUB in
